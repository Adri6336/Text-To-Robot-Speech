# Text-To-Robot-Speech
Uses Google's gTTS module to easily create robo text readin' on command.

To use, you'll first need to get the gtts module and set up Python 3.9. To install using pip on Windows (comes with standard Python installations), do the following: 
1. Right click the windows icon
2. Press "Windows PowerShell (Admin)
3. Type "pip install gtts", then enter -- the computer will do the rest

With gtts installed, you should be able to run the script. If something goes wrong, you can just use the executable I prepared instead; it will run the script without any effort on your end, though it will be a bit slower to start up.
